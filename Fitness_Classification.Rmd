##by Shreyas Ramani

###In this mini project, the aim is to analyze the data in the training set and classify it into A,B,C,D or E. The data contains a lot of fitness variables based on fitbit type devices and the goal is to classify them into catergories of exercise.

#Installing the packages and Libraries
###caret and ggplot2 are the various packages that are required to install for importing the required libraries.
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("randomForest")

#Importing Libraries
###caret library i.e the classification and regression Trees are imported.
library(caret)
###readr library is used for reading csv files in R.
library(readr)

library(rpart)

library(randomForest)
#Getting the Data
###reading the training dataset
pml_training <- read_csv("Data Science, John Hopkins/pml-training.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!"))
summary(pml_training)
#reading the test dataset
pml_testing <- read_csv("Data Science, John Hopkins/pml-testing.csv",na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!"))
summary(pml_testing)

#Exploratory Data Analysis
###for obtaining the type of each column
str(pml_training)

###for checking the number of rows and columns in the dataset, the train dataset contains 19622 rows and 160 columns.
dim(pml_training)

###taking a count for the final results
table(pml_training$classe)

#Cleaning the Data
###Dealing with missing values
Count_na = sapply(1:dim(pml_training)[2],function(x)sum(is.na(pml_training[,x])))
List_na = which(Count_na>0)
colnames(pml_training[,c(1:7)])

###removing the null values from the training set
pml_training = pml_training[,-List_na]
pml_training = pml_training[,-c(1:7)]
pml_training$classe = factor(pml_training$classe)

###removing the null values from the test set
pml_testing = pml_testing[,-List_na]
pml_testing = pml_testing[,-c(1:7)]

#Building the Model

##Decision Tree
Classifier = rpart(formula = classe~.,data=pml_training)
y_pred = predict(Classifier,pml_testing)
print(y_pred)

y_pred_actual = predict(Classifier,pml_testing,type="class")
print(y_pred_actual)

###confusion Matrix
cm = table(pml_testing[-1],y_pred)
print(cm)
##Random Forest

rfclassifier = randomForest(formula = classe~.,data=pml_training, ntree = 10)
y_pred_rf = predict(rfclassifier,pml_testing)
print(y_pred_rf)
